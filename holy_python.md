#-------Exercise 1---------------------

 ``` # 1.) Replace "type here" on line 2 with "Hello World!"
print("hello world") ``` 

 ``` # 2.) You can assign "Hello World!" to the variable below on line 3.
my_text="Hello World!"
print(my_text) ``` 

 ``` # 3.) Type a couple of different values on line 9 inside the print function. Make sure they are separated by commas.    
print("H","e","l","l","o") ``` 

#---------Exercise 2--------------------

 ``` #Type here. Assign a number to the variable: glass_of_water
glass_of_water=  3
print("I drank", glass_of_water, "glasses of water today." ``` 

 ``` #Fill the print function so it prints glass_of_water
glass_of_water=3
glass_of_water=glass_of_water + 1
print(glass_of_water) ``` 

#---------Exercise 3--------------------

 ``` #Assign an integer to the variable, then print it.
men_stepped_on_the_moon= 12
print(12) ``` 

 ``` #Type a couple of words or a short sentence for your variable, then print it.
my_reason_for_coding= "Hello Hello"
print(my_reason_for_coding) ``` 

 ``` #Assign a float with 2 decimals to the variable below. If you don't wan't to search the value you can check out Hint 1.
global_mean_sea_level_2018=21.36 
#Type your code here.
global_mean_sea_level_2018= 21.36 
print(global_mean_sea_level_2018) ``` 

 ``` #Assign True or False to the variable below then print it.

staying_alive= True
print(staying_alive ``` )

 ``` men_stepped_on_the_moon=12

#Type your code here.

answer_1= type(men_stepped_on_the_moon)


print(answer_1) ``` 

 ``` #my_temp variable is a float (because it has decimals). On line 9, convert it to an integer.

my_temp=97.70

answer_6= int(my_temp) ```
